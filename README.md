# surchy

> Surchy is the dead simple text file searching app.

Surchy is built for the (admittedly specific) purpose of searching strings against any number of text files.

It's primary audience is for those who do not want or are unable to use tools like grep.

- Write to accommodate other encodings besides utf8
